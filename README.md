# os
An os that i felt like making. The code is mostly just copypasted but its still kinda cool.
I got the code from https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones
You can use the source code of gcc and ld to compile using the instructions provided in the website above.
All the code is in src/
## run
To run you can use the iso in src/, I use the qemu emulator. You need to install it and use the command, qemu-system-i386 -cdrom myos.iso (may need an extra package. On arch it is called qemu-arch-extra)
